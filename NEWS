1.1.0-rc1 Release candidate 1 for version 1.1.0. The upcomming release
	introduces much nicer dialogs and more algorithms in the "edit menu"
	window. If you have guile installed, you can now even load your own
	algorithms at runtime.
1.0.2	This release includes minor enhancements, e.g. a !12Ton MIDI-file may
        be passed as command line arg. An experimental guile interface is
        included.
1.0.0	All bugs found in the beta release were fixed successfully and thus
	the status changes from "beta" to "stable". The only major difference
	is that printing now prints all 24 forms instead of only the basic
	form.
0.90	This is the initial (beta) release. If no bugs are reported within next
	weeks, this version will become the stable release 1.0.
