Short Description
-----------------
wx12Ton is a complete rewrite of the DOS shareware program !12Ton, which I
wrote in the mid-nineties.

At the beginning of the last century twelve-note composition was a celebrated
new technique to compose music without tonal sounds. wx12Ton now helps to
compose and analyse such music. In particular it displays the 48 forms of a
twelve-note series (which is a lengthy task if you do it by hand) and tests the
series for some particular features such as tonal phrases or whether all
intervals occur in the series. A twelve-note series exactly consists of all
twelve different notes within an octave (c, c sharp,..., b flat, b) and thus
there are about half a billion possible series. However, since every series has
48 forms, not all of them are considered to be independent. If one further
imposes some constraints the series should satisfy, the number of valid series
can reduce to some 10'000 series. wx12Ton allows to search for series
satisfying certain criteria.

The program is written in C++ using wxWidgets and I will take care, that that
it compiles and runs at least for wxMSW (Windows 9x/ME/NT/2000/XP) and wxGTK
(GTK2 on Linux). I will provide binaries for Win9x/ME/NT/2000/XP.

Requirements
------------
*Windows 9x/ME/NT/2000/XP*
It is strongly recommended to use the binaries (the .zip file), which are provided at the download page, since compiling under Windows is tricky despite the existence of a ./configure script. The provided binaries should run out of the box for Win9x/ME/NT/2000/XP. No installation is required, just unzip the package to a destination you like.

*Other Platforms*
Since binary packages for other platforms are much harder to generate (at least
for Linux; I do not have access to any further platform), you need to compile
from source. However feel free to provide binary packages, I will add your link
to the wx12Ton homepage. The source code is available as tarball from the
download page. In order to compile wx12Ton you will need at least the wxWidgets
library >=2.2.0 (http://www.wxwidgets.org/). In order to play a series on your
MIDI-device or sound card, you will need in addition either a working
MIDI-player or the SDL_mixer library
(http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer). If you further plan to use guile
algorithms, you must have installed guile >=1.6.0
(http://www.gnu.org/software/guile).

wx12Ton was tested to compile well on Linux (GTK2, fedora-1.90-test1) and
MinGW(3.1.0-1)+MinSYS(1.0.10-rc-5) on Windows XP home edition; in addition
basic functionality was tested for wxX11(2.5.2). Please report successful
compiles for other platforms.
